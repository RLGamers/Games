BASIC GeneralGame Outline

Game Class
    * For now, all games are repeating sequential players
    * game_state: What the board looks like now (e.g. 2D array for chess)
    * must implement each abstract method here in base classes
    * run by calling run(debug=True/False) method once

Action Class:
    * An action on game_state
        * isValidAction(Action) method

Agent Class
    * Can remember history of board states through Game.game_history
    * may also internally want to keep a list of ** actions **
    * getNextAction(Game) : Action, this is the most important
